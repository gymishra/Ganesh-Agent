4. Bedrock AI models analyze and categorize discovered APIs
5. Configuration Store is updated with new API mappings

### 2. Integration Phase
1. AWS services (Q Business, Bedrock) request access to enterprise data
2. ADoNIS Control Plane receives integration requests
3. Integration Orchestrator identifies appropriate Neural Agents
4. Secure API connections are established through Neural Agents
5. Data flows through encrypted channels with real-time monitoring

### 3. Maintenance Phase
1. Neural Agents continuously monitor API changes
2. AI models detect schema changes and version updates
3. Automatic configuration updates maintain compatibility
4. Alerts are generated for breaking changes requiring attention
5. Performance metrics are collected and analyzed

## Deployment Architecture
