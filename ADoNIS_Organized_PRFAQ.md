## BACKGROUND

### Current Market Challenges

**Enterprise Integration Pain Points:**
- Enterprise customers spend millions annually managing disparate integration tools and frameworks
- Teams waste thousands of development hours maintaining redundant connectors across Amazon services
- Struggle to keep pace with rapid API changes and security requirements
- Each AWS service requires custom connectors for enterprise applications like ServiceNow, Jira, SAP, and Workday

**SAP Ecosystem Integration Crisis:**
- **SAP Joule Initiative Limitations**: SAP's AI assistant requires extensive custom connector development that most customers cannot execute effectively
- **BTP Complexity Challenge**: SAP's Business Technology Platform demands specialized integration skills that are scarce in the market, with customers lacking the expertise required for interface development
- **Rise Migration Dependencies**: 8,000+ SAP Rise customers need seamless integration with existing AWS services during their cloud transformation
- **Gen AI Readiness Gap**: SAP's 440,000+ customers want to leverage AI capabilities but lack the integration infrastructure to connect their SAP systems with modern AI platforms like AWS Bedrock

**Market Dynamics:**
- **SAP's Integration Dilemma**: SAP developing connector solutions similar to Amazon Q Business with limited success, creating a $4.2B opportunity for ADoNIS within the SAP ecosystem
- **Traditional Solutions Gap**: Existing frameworks like Strands and MCP provide foundational capabilities but lack ready-to-use enterprise solutions and SAP-specific intelligence
- **Agentic AI Requirements**: Every AWS service will require seamless connectivity to enterprise applications for intelligent decision-making, particularly critical for SAP customers planning AI initiatives (77% in next 24 months)

**Current Integration Landscape:**
- Fragmented connectivity across services
- Manual discovery overhead requiring significant engineering effort
- Linear scaling constraints with each new service launch
- Heavy reliance on partners for application-specific connectors

### Strategic Context
The transition into Agentic AI era creates an architectural bottleneck without automated integration capabilities. Enterprise applications need to:
- Read contextual data for intelligent decision-making
- Execute actions based on AI-driven insights  
- Provide real-time responses to dynamic business conditions
