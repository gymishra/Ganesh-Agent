## Key Success Factors

### Critical Hiring Priorities (First 90 Days)
1. **Chief Architect** - Define overall system architecture
2. **Principal ML Engineers** - Establish AI/ML foundation
3. **Technical Program Managers** - Coordinate cross-team efforts
4. **Principal Security Engineer** - Establish security framework

### Technology Decisions Impact
- **Build vs. Buy for AI Models**: Could save $2-3M if leveraging existing Bedrock capabilities
- **Container Platform Choice**: EKS vs. ECS decision impacts $500K in development costs
- **Multi-region Strategy**: Adds $3-5M if implemented from day one

### Market Timing Considerations
- **Accelerated Timeline**: +25% cost but 6-month faster time-to-market
- **Delayed Start**: Risk of competitive disadvantage worth $50M+ in lost opportunity

This comprehensive cost estimate provides a realistic foundation for budgeting and resource planning for the ADoNIS development project.
