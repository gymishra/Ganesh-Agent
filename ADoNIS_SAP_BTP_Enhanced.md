## RISK

### SAP-Specific Risks and Mitigation

**SAP Partnership and Competitive Risks:**

The primary risk in the SAP ecosystem involves potential competitive tension if SAP perceives ADoNIS as threatening their BTP integration strategy, which could result in reduced cooperation or development of competing solutions. However, this risk is mitigated by positioning ADoNIS as complementary to SAP's capabilities rather than competitive, focusing on enhancing SAP Joule and BTP rather than replacing them. SAP's historical partnership approach with cloud providers and their current integration challenges suggest they would welcome a solution that accelerates their AI initiatives and improves customer satisfaction with BTP implementations. Additionally, the significant technical complexity and time investment required for SAP to develop equivalent AI-powered integration capabilities makes direct competition unlikely in the near term.

**SAP Customer Adoption and Technical Risks:**

SAP customers are traditionally conservative in adopting new integration technologies due to the critical nature of their SAP systems and concerns about business disruption during implementation. This adoption risk is mitigated through a phased implementation approach that begins with non-critical integrations and gradually expands to core business processes, ensuring minimal disruption to existing SAP operations. Technical risks include the complexity of SAP's diverse module landscape and frequent system updates that could impact integration stability. These risks are addressed through comprehensive SAP system testing, automated regression testing for SAP updates, and maintaining dedicated SAP expertise within the ADoNIS development team to ensure rapid response to SAP-specific technical challenges.

**Market and Competitive Dynamics in SAP Space:**

The SAP integration market includes established players like MuleSoft and Boomi who may enhance their SAP capabilities in response to ADoNIS, potentially reducing our competitive advantage and market share. This risk is mitigated by ADoNIS's unique AI-powered approach and deep AWS integration that competitors cannot easily replicate, particularly the seamless connection between SAP systems and AWS AI services. The risk of SAP developing internal competing capabilities is managed through strategic partnership agreements and continued innovation that maintains ADoNIS's technological leadership. Additionally, the large and growing SAP customer base provides sufficient market opportunity even with increased competition, and first-mover advantage in AI-powered SAP integration creates significant barriers for competitors to overcome.
