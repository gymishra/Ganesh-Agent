## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "View not found"
**Solution:** Check if the view ID matches exactly:
- `com.sap.adt.eclipse.plugin.views.SAPFileExplorerViewAdvanced`
- `com.sap.adt.eclipse.plugin.views.SAPFileExplorerViewEnhanced`

### Issue: "Plugin not loading"
**Solution:** 
1. Check Problems view for compilation errors
2. Verify MANIFEST.MF dependencies
3. Clean and rebuild projects

### Issue: "CoreException when opening files"
**Solution:** This is expected for now - the plugin uses mock data
- Real SAP connection would be needed for actual file operations
